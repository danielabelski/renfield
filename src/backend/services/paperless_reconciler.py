"""Retry re-enqueuer for Paperless filing — LIGHT, no Docling in the backend.

The document-worker files each folder/email-ingest document into Paperless during
ingest (``paperless_filing_hook``), reusing the worker's own high-quality Docling
OCR. That is the normal path. If the hook couldn't settle (Paperless was down when
the doc was processed), the doc stays ``paperless_state='pending'`` after it has
``completed``.

This periodic backend scan re-ENQUEUES those stragglers as ``paperless_refile``
worker tasks — the heavy Docling/OCR + MCP work runs in the WORKER (its home);
the backend only enqueues. This is the fix for the OOM outage: the backend used to
run Docling here (concurrent, atop the full app) and exceeded its 6 Gi limit.

A grace window (``paperless_reconciler_refile_grace_seconds``) keeps the scan from
racing an initial filing that is still in flight (the hook runs fire-and-forget
after the doc is marked completed), so a fresh doc isn't refiled while its first
attempt is mid-upload.
